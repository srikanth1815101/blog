### 1. **Robotaxis Expand Across Cities Worldwide**

Baidu’s Apollo Go has completed over 11 million autonomous rides and is now launching robotaxi services across Asia and the Middle East in collaboration with global transport platforms. Meanwhile, in New York City, Waymo has started pilot testing robotaxis with safety drivers behind the wheel.

> **Quote:**\
> “Robotaxis are live in more places—but public trust and complex city layouts are still big challenges.”

### 5. **India Leads the Way in Smart Farming**

India is becoming a global example in AI-powered agriculture. Recent developments include:

* **Maharashtra’s ₹500 crore MahaAgri-AI Policy** to introduce drones, sensors, mobile apps, and smart analytics to farmers.
* **Telangana and Andhra Pradesh** are using AI for real-time advisories, disaster planning, and crop monitoring.

> **Note:**\
> Farmers using AI tools have reported up to 30–40% increase in crop yields and major cost savings.

### 6. **The Rise of Farm Drones and Mobile Labs**

Indian states are also deploying flying drones for pesticide spraying, satellite mapping for weather prediction, and mobile labs that travel village to village offering AI-powered crop health checks.

> **Real-Life Use Case:**\
> A cotton farmer in Vidarbha reduced his water usage by 40% using AI weather predictions and sensor-based irrigation systems.
