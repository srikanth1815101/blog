This Cookie Policy explains how CSRGO Blog ("we", "us", and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at https://blog.csrgo.com/. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## 1. What are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

## 2. How We Use Cookies

Since this Site is a static blog with no login functionality, **we do not use first-party cookies to track your personal identity.** We do not have a shopping cart, user dashboard, or preferences that require persistent storage of your personal data.

However, we may use cookies for the following purposes:

*   **Analytics:** To understand how visitors use the Site (e.g., counting visitors, checking popular pages).
*   **Future Advertising:** If we display ads in the future, our advertising partners may use cookies to serve relevant ads.

## 3. Third-Party Cookies

Because we rely on third-party services for hosting, analytics, and potential advertising, these parties may set cookies on your device:

*   **Google Analytics:** Used to collect anonymous statistical data about usage of the website.
*   **Google AdSense (Future):** If and when implemented, Google may use cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to serve ads based on your visit to this Site and other sites on the Internet.
*   **GitHub Pages:** Our hosting provider may use cookies necessary for the secure operation of the hosting platform.

## 4. Your Control Over Cookies

You have the right to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your browser preferences.

*   **Browser Controls:** Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You can usually find these settings in the "Options" or "Preferences" menu of your browser.
*   **Advertising Opt-Out:** You can opt out of personalized advertising from Google by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website, though your access to some functionality and areas of our website might be restricted (though for this static blog, impact is minimal).
