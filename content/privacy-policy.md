This Privacy Policy describes how CSRGO Blog ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our website at https://blog.csrgo.com/ (the "Site").

## 1. No Personal Information Collected

We want to be transparent: **We do not collect any personal information from you.**

*   **No Accounts:** We do not have user accounts, login systems, or signup forms.
*   **No Comments:** We do not have a commenting system that requires you to submit personal details.
*   **No Direct Collection:** We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.

## 2. Hosting and Technology (GitHub Pages)

This Site is a static website hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

*   **GitHub:** As our hosting provider, GitHub may collect access logs containing your IP address to ensure the security and reliability of their service. This is standard technical practice for all websites.

## 3. Analytics and Cookies

While we do not collect personal data, we use third-party tools to understand how our Site is used.

*   **Google Analytics:** We use Google Analytics to track aggregate usage data (e.g., which pages are popular, visitor country, device type). Google Analytics uses cookies to collect this anonymous data. It does not identify you personally to us.
*   **Cookies:** Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You may disable cookies at any time; however, this may limit your use of certain features on our website.

## 4. Advertising

Currently, we do not assist in serving direct advertisements. However, we reserve the right to introduce advertising (such as Google AdSense) in the future to support the maintenance of this Site.

If and when we implement advertising:
*   Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
*   Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
*   Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

## 5. External Links

Our Site contains links to external websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites, products, or services.
